Machine Learning (ML) model implementation refers to the process of developing, training, evaluating, and deploying a machine learning algorithm to solve a specific problem using data. This process involves several key steps that ensure the model can learn patterns, make predictions, and generalize well to unseen data.

üîç Problem Definition and Data Preparation
The first stage in ML implementation is identifying the problem‚Äîclassification, regression, clustering, etc.‚Äîand collecting relevant data. The data is then cleaned and preprocessed. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and transforming features. In text-based models (like spam detection), text preprocessing involves tokenization, normalization, and vectorization.
